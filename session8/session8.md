# Session 8: Single Cell RNA Analysis

# Expected learning outcome

To understand the basics of scRNA data analysis with R, how to use scRNA packages to creating UMI distribution plots, filtering, normalization, clustering and annotation. 
This is a beginner level lecture in scRNA data analysis.

## Introduction to scRNA-Seq

In previous sessions, we have covered basics of R programming, drawing graphics and figures, and introductory RNA-Seq data analysis.
Today, we will briefly cover single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-Seq), processing of scRNA-Seq reads and then we will extend on what he have learned 
on R and start programming for the essential scRNA-Seq data analysis.  

Why Single Cell ?

## Getting Started

Please install R 4.0.5 into your local computer. 

1. First please install R to your computer

   <https://cran.r-project.org/>

   For windows;
   <https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/R-4.0.5-win.exe>

   For mac;
   <https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/R-4.0.5.pkg></br>

2. Second, please install R-Studio;

   <https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/>
   
3. We will now install required R packages for conducting today's scRNA analysis practices before covering the basics of scRNA-Seq. Run the commands below. It should install the 'devtools' package, necessary for installing scRNA analysis package of 'SignallingSingleCell' from GitHub. **Installing devtools may take long, please try to install before the session**.

```
    install.packages(“devtools”)
    library(devtools)
```

If Rstudio asks "Do you want to install from sources the package which needs compilation? (Yes/no/cancel)", just type "n" for no, and hit Enter to continue.

    Do you want to install from sources the package which needs compilation? (Yes/no/cancel) n

If R asks to update old packages; please dont write anything and hit Enter to continue:

```
   These packages have more recent versions available.
   It is recommended to update all of them.
   Which would you like to update?
   
   1: All                            
   2: CRAN packages only             
   3: None                           
   4: tibble  (3.1.1 -> 3.1.2) [CRAN]
   5: stringi (1.5.3 -> 1.6.2) [CRAN]
   
   Enter one or more numbers, or an empty line to skip updates:
```

4. Now that we can use 'devtools' package and install GitHub packages, lets install 'SignallingSingleCell'.

Similar to Step 3, answer "n" or "no" if Rstudio asks you to install from source packages, and just enter if R asks to update packages

```
    devtools::install_github(“kgellatl/SignallingSingleCell”)
    library(SignallingSingleCell)
```
