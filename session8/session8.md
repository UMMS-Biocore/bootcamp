## Introduction

Today we will do some basic exercises to start learning R. R is a programming language and software environment for statistical analysis, 
graphics representation and reporting. You can either download and install R into your computer or use R in the cluster. You can use R with a 
user interface called RStudio or you might prefer using R from the command line. There are a couple of ways to use R. In this tutorial we will 
use the UMass Cluster. **However, we also want you to install R and R-Studio into your local computer for the next session.**

### Installing R and R-Studio to your local computer

Please install R 4.0.5 into your local computer **to use it in the next session.**
